# Data Science and Visualization College Projects

These are the data science and visualization projects I completed for my DSV (Data Science and Visualization) subject during the 6th semester of college. Each project showcases different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Dataset Analysis

Analyzed the Titanic dataset to understand the data structure, handle missing values, and visualize correlations.

**Key Features:**
- Data loading and cleaning
- Statistical summaries
- Pairplots and heatmaps for data visualization

### 2. Iris Dataset Analysis

Performed statistical analysis and visualizations on the Iris dataset to explore species-specific measurements and determine the best measurement for classification.

**Key Features:**
- Mean and standard deviation calculations
- Analysis of species-specific measurements
- Range span analysis for measurement effectiveness

### 3. Synthetic Iris Data Classification

Created synthetic Iris dataset and applied K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression for classification, evaluating model performance.

**Key Features:**
- Synthetic data generation
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and misclassification analysis

### 4. Clickthrough Rate Analysis

Analyzed clickthrough rates across different age groups, visualizing trends and patterns over time.

**Key Features:**
- Violin and swarm plots for impressions and CTR
- Trend analysis over time
- Quantile and max CTR analysis

### 5. Zoo Dataset Classification

Classified animal species from the Zoo dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors and visualized data distributions and correlations.

**Key Features:**
- Feature scaling and classification
- Pairplots, heatmaps, and distribution visualizations
